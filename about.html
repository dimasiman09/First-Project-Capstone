    <h1>Hi there! my name is Dimas Immannulloh</h1>
    <p>
      i'm a last year student in Industrial Engineering at UPN "Veteran" Jawa
      Timur. I'm a curious and enthusiastic individual who is passionate about
      design and programming.

      You'll often find me exploring new concepts, learning new skills, and
      engaging in various design and programming projects. I love to challenge
      myself and push my creative boundaries to come up with visually appealing
      and functional designs, as well as writing code to bring ideas to life.

      I'm an adaptable individual who is comfortable in different environments
      and enjoys making friends. I believe in the power of connections and
      building meaningful relationships with fellow professionals. You can find
      evidence of my dedication to my studies and professional growth on my
      social media profiles, such as Instagram and LinkedIn.

      I'm committed to continuous self-improvement and always strive to learn
      and grow with passion. I believe that there's always room for improvement,
      and I actively seek out opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge.
      I'm known for my friendly and approachable nature, making me a great team
      player and someone who easily connects with others.

      I'm excited about the journey ahead and eager to connect with fellow
      professionals to share insights, learn from their experiences, and
      contribute to the design and programming community. Let's connect and
